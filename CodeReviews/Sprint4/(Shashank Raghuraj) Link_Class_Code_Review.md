The Inventory.cs class show excellent readability with clear, well-structured code. The Dictionary implementation for tracking items is straightforward. The methods are concise and their purposes are their names - AddItem(), GetItemCount(), and Reset() all show their functionality effectively. The Reset() method's implementation using a List to store keys is really cool and adds to the readability. Overall, there isn't much that isn't readble, and each method is clear and easy to understand.
