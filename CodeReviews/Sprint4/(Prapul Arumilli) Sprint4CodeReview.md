# Code Review by Prapul Arumilli

**Date**: 11/12  
**File Reviewed**: `SoundManager.cs`  
**Author**: Eli Click<br> 
**Time Spent**: 15 minutes  

## Readability

The file is very easy to read with all the functionality easily understandable and viewable. 

## Quality

Everything is organized nicely and all the functionality is nicely abstracted within the class. 

### Suggested Improvement
- More comments could improve the overall understanding of the file.
- Maybe customization of sounds based on the room and that functionality could be implemented into the function.
