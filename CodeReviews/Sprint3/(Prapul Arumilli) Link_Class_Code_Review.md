Reviewing: Link.cs

Minutes for Review: 10

Readbility Comments:
 - The transition to making everything private was done very efficiently.
 - The updates to the switch blocks and the getter and setter methods were very clean and easy to read.
 - Some variables could've been made as private variables inside other classes instead of private variables in Link with get/set methods.

Code Quality Comments:
  - Commented efficiently
  - Good job keeping the methods short and concise

Hypothetical:
 Some of these private variables could be better served by making them private within the item classes or in other classes rather than making multiple get set methods for the sake of more readable and more organized code. This would involve transitioning all the variables over to each of the class files and changing access as necessary.
